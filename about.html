        <h1>About me!</h1>
        
        <p>Nice to meet you! I’m Azrael Casilan, an IT student based in Winnipeg, Manitoba. I work with CSS and javascript to provide interactive and accessible experiences to the end user. I’m glad you found your way to my little corner of the web. I plan to make this page continue to update as my skills grow and change with me. </p>
        <p>I’ve been learning web development skills ever since I was in high school, with concepts like building wireframes to forming mockups, what types of designs appeal to the end demographic. Ever since then, I’ve been scribbling down solutions and ideas that I've wanted to solve with my own website. </p>
        <p>My interest in web development overlaps with my interest in game development. My dream is to one day be able to deliver an experience like I’ve had growing up on websites like Webkinz and Chicken Smoothie. I want to bring back an era of the internet where technology felt more welcome and awe inspiring. </p>
